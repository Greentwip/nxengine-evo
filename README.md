## Differences from original nxengine:

* Port to SDL2 ( thanks to https://github.com/PIlin/NXEngine-iOS )
* More resolutions and widescreen support up to FullHD (thanks to https://github.com/EXL/NXEngine )
* Fullscreen for any resolution
* Gamepad with force-feedback support.
* Localization support.
* Mimiga mask ending pictures (re-drawn by me)
* Modern main menu
* Support for "New" and "Remastered" tracks from CS+
* Header-dependency hell cleaned up. No more autogenerated headers
* Cleaned up nx.h
* Lists/maps from haiku replaced with std::vector/map
* smalfont -> smallfont
* removed built-in data extractor
* removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway
* fixed tons of warnings and undefined behaviour

## Building
* [Linux](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/wiki/Building-linux-version)
* [Windows](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/wiki/Building-windows-version)

## Running
