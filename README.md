## Differences from original nxengine:

* Port to SDL2 ( thanks to https://github.com/PIlin/NXEngine-iOS )
* More resolutions and proper widescreen support up to FullHD (thanks to https://github.com/EXL/NXEngine )
* Fixed tons of gameplay bugs.
* Gamepad with force-feedback support.
* Localization support.
* Mimiga mask ending pictures.
* Animated facepics.
* Modern main menu.
* Support for custom soundtracks.
* Initial mod support.
* Vita/Switch ports.
* Cleaner and partly refactored code.
* Removed built-in data extractor.
* Removed replays, as they were buggy/not implemented anyway.

## Building
* [Linux](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/wiki/Building-linux-version)
* [Windows](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/wiki/Building-windows-version)
* [OSX](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/wiki/Building-OSX-version)


## Running
 * For source builds see [Running](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/wiki/Running) on wiki.
 * or just use prepackaged [releases](https://github.com/nxengine/nxengine-evo/releases)
   (OSX builds are done on 10.13, so that's a minimum requirement, windows builds require [MSVC2015 runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53587)

May (and most definitely) contain bugs.
